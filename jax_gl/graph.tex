\begin{problem}
Given a finite graph $G$, find an embedding of $G$ into a relatively low dimensional Euclidean space in a way that captures
relevant information about the structure of the graph.
\end{problem}
\bigskip\noindent
\textbf{Deep Learning} algorithms in general are typically based on neural networks and are characterized by non-linearity and hierarchical structure.  

\bigskip\noindent
Deep learning techniques for graph embedding sample structure from a large graph and apply techniques arising from
natural language processing to those samples to construct an embedding.
